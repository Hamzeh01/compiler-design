# Compiler Project

This project includes a custom-built compiler, complete with a lexer and parser, designed to process a specific grammar. The parser outputs the results in JSON format, which can then be visualized as an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).

## Lexer and Parser

The lexer, built using the PLY (Python Lex-Yacc) library, tokenize the input based on predefined rules. It recognizes basic elements like identifiers, operators, and parentheses.

The parser, also using PLY, takes the tokenized output from the lexer and parses it according to the grammar rules defined. It supports basic arithmetic operations and parentheses for enforcing precedence. The output from the parser is a JSON file representing the parsed structure.

## Visualizing the AST

To visualize the AST generated by the parser, use the following website: [Vanya's JSON to Tree Visualizer](https://vanya.jp.net/vtree/). This tool converts the JSON output into a visual tree structure, making it easier to understand the parsing process.

## Project Screenshots

These screenshots demonstrate various test cases and their respective outputs, both in JSON format and visualized as ASTs.

## Steps to Launch the Project

To get started with this compiler project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have Python installed, along with the PLY library. You can install PLY using pip: `pip install ply`

3. **View the JSON Output**:
The parser will output the results in a JSON format. You can view this file directly in any text editor or IDE to inspect the parsed structure.

4. **Visualize the AST**:
For a more intuitive understanding of the parsing process, you can visualize the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree). Copy the JSON output and paste it into the [Vanya's JSON to Tree Visualizer](https://vanya.jp.net/vtree/). This web tool will convert the JSON structure into a visual tree format.

Following these steps should allow you to successfully launch and test the compiler project on your machine.
